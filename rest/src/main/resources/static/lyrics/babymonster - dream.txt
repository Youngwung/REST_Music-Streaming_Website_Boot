Sometimes I don't know who I am
Doubting myself again
Can't find a light in the dark

And I'm
Finding myself in the rain
Trying to get out of the pain
Know that I've come so far

I made a promise
I'll never run and hide

I'm getting stronger
I'm getting stronger
A little longer
I'm getting stronger

Now I finally found my wings
I let go of everything
Decided to follow my heart

And I’m
Finally able to breathe
Finally able to see
Just who I was born to be
I'm waking up in my dream

Oh yeah that fires in my eyes
No sleep you keep them lullabies
Cross hearts I’ve been the one to ride
Vroom vroom
I’ll see you later bye

I keep it a hundred
We one in a million No billion No kidding No ceiling
That’s limitless
Stars in the sky we infinite
Envisioned it
Just how I pictured it

Here we are all of the lights
Spotlight is blinding my eyes
Just breathe and live and let it die

Lift up my head I’mma rise
Spread out my wings I’m a fly fly high

I'm getting stronger
I'm getting stronger
A little longer
I'm getting stronger

Now I finally found my wings
I let go of everything
Decided to follow my heart

I don’t care what they say
My life is not a game
Never gonna run away

So don’t wake me up
(Finally able to breathe)
Can’t wake me up
(Nothing can wake me up)

I’m waking up in my dream
