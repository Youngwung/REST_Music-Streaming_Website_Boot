When tomorrow comes
I'll be on my own
Feeling frightened up
the things that I don't know
When tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
Tomorrow comes
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky
And in the dark I found
I stop and I won't fly
And I sing along
I sing along
then I sing along

I got all I need
when I got you and I
I look around me
and see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark
but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me gettin' me
through the night

Can't stop my heart
when you shinin' in my eyes
Can't lie it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark
but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me gettin' me
through the night
Cause you're my flash light
You're my flash light
you're my flash light

I see the shadows long
beneath the mountain top
I'm not afraid
when the rain won't stop
Cause you light the way
You light the way
you light the way

I got all I need
when I got you and I
I look around me
and see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark
but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me gettin' me
through the night

Can't stop my heart
when you shinin' in my eyes
Can't lie it's sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark
but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me gettin' me
through the night

light light light
You're my flashlight
light light
You're my flashlight
light light
You're my flashlight
You're my flash oh

I got all I need
when I got you and I
I look around me
and see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark
but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me gettin' me
through the night

Can't stop my heart
when you shinin' in my eyes
Can't lie it's a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark
but you're my flashlight
You're gettin' me gettin' me
through the night
Cause you're my flashlight
Cause you're my flashlight
You're my flashlight
you're my flashlight
light light
you're my flashlight
light light yeah
You're my flashlight
