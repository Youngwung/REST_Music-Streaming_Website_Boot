Insecure
In her skin
Like a puppet, a girl on a string

Broke away
Learned to fly
If you want her back, gotta let her shine

So, it looks like the joke's on you
'Cuz the girl that you thought you knew 

She's so gone
That's so over now
She's so gone
You won't find her around
You can look but you won't see
The girl I used to be
'Cuz she, she's so gone

Here I am
This is me
And I'm stronger than you ever thought I'd be

Are you shocked?
Are you mad?
That your missin' out on who I really am

Now it looks like the joke's on you
'Cuz the girl that you thought you knew

She's so gone
That's so over now
She's so gone
You won't find her around
You can look but you won't see
The girl I used to be
'Cuz she, she's so gone

Away, like history, 
She's so gone, 
Baby this is me... yeah... 

She's so gone
That's so over now
She's so gone
You won't find her around
You can look but you won't see
The girl I used to be
'Cuz she, she's so gone

She's so gone

You can look but you won't see
The girl I used to be
'Cuz she, she's so gone

She's so gone, she's so gone... 

gone, gone, gone.
