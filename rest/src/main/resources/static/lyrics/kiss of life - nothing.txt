First of all I would’ve never looked back at you
I would’ve never looked back at you
If you didn’t chase me I would not be with you
No, no I would not be with you

Now I’m not picking up when you call me
No I’m not gon’ respond when you want me
So better keep in mind that
You were nothing other than a mindset

Guess I should have known not to give all of me
At the time having my love was all you need

And now you leave
With all of my energy
Not considering how I feel
Imma need that back from you
Need that back from you but

It’s not worth it
Not worth it
It’s not worth it
The way you make me feel
I’m hurting
I’m hurting
See I’m hurting

So why did it take me this long
To see that you’re not worth my songs
But now I know
It’s not worth it
Not worth it
It’s not worth it

Remember the days you begged for me to stay, huh
Funny how that changed to you going away now
Nope, can’t get with folks who need me
Cuz what they need is healing
And in the end who takes a chance is bleeding

Now I’m bleeding out on the ground you don’t care
Rub your fingers through another person’s hair
But better keep in mind that
You were nothing other than a mindset

Guess I should have known not to give all of me
At the time having my love was all you need

And now you leave
With all of my energy
Not considering how I feel
Imma need that back from you
Need that back from you but

It’s not worth it
Not worth it
It’s not worth it
The way you make me feel
I’m hurting
I’m hurting
See I’m hurting

So why did it take me this long
To see that you’re not worth my songs
But now I know
It’s not worth it
Not worth it
It’s not worth it

You were never on your own
Not strong enough to be alone
Can you call yourself a man
No I don’t think you can

And look what got us here
Imma need that back from you
Need that back from you but

It’s not worth it
Not worth it
It’s not worth it
The way you make me feel
I’m hurting
I’m hurting
See I’m hurting

So why did it take me this long
To see that you’re not worth my songs
But now I know
It’s not worth it
Not worth it
It’s not worth it
