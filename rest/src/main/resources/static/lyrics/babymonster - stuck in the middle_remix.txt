Maybe it’s make believe
Maybe it can be true
I try to tell myself
I’m not in love with you
I thought that I knew everything
I guess I don’t know anything yeah

I get emotional
And hypothetical
Wondering if there are all kinds of things
I’m not supposed to know
I try my best to let it go (Let go)
Baby then you bring me back
Bring me back

You lift my feet off of the ground
Keep me spinning around and around

I don’t ever wanna come down
From your arms

You tell me that you need me
Then you walk away
Keep promising forever
With the words you say it’s true
Don’t know what I’m supposed to do

I’m stuck in the middle with you you you you you
With you you you
Oh boy you got me really confused
Don’t know what I’m supposed to do
I’m stuck in the middle with you

You were the spark
Light in the dark
Gave you my everything
Pulling me in
Pushing me out
Pulling me back again
Don’t know if your mind is made up
But I know that nobody wanna be stuck
You are the one that I want
All I can promise you now is my love

You say you want me (yeah yeah)
You say you care (yeah yeah)
When we’re together
Are you even there
And you
Gave me the keys to your heart
Yeah you
Made me believe from the start (Bring it back)
Now all that I know is
I got all this L.O.V.E

You lift my feet off of the ground
Keep me spinning around and around

I don’t ever wanna come down
From your arms

You tell me that you need me
Then you walk away
Keep promising forever
With the words you say it’s true
Don’t know what I’m supposed to do

I’m stuck in the middle with you you you you you
With you you you
Oh boy you got me really confused
Don’t know what I’m supposed to do
I’m stuck in the middle with you

You tell me that you need me
Then you walk away
Keep promising forever
Oh boy you got me really confused
Don’t know what I’m supposed to do
I’m stuck in the middle with you
