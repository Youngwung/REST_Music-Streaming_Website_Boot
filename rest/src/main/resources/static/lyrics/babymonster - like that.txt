Something my mind cannot erase
If we keep staring
Then I might have to

Might have to start to walk your way
I wanna hear what you would say
You got high standards
And I do too

Cause all those girls

(They don’t)
But I know I know
The way the way
To make to make sure you never leave

If I come close baby would you like that
If I give some would you give it right back
If I show you that I know where it’s at
Baby would you like that
