Look at what you've done
Stand still falling away from me
When it takes so long
For I desire
what do you want to be

I'm holding on
Yourself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now every other day
I've been watching you

I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right Now I'm on the outside

No you give me no reason
For me to stay close to you
Tell me what love has do
How are we still breathing
It's never for us to choose
I'll be the strength in you

I'm holding on
Yourself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now every other day
I've been watching you

I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right Now I'm on the outside

I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right Now I'm on the outside
